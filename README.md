The dashboard aims to help financial analysts and stakeholders make informed decisions by visualizing critical financial trends.

# Key Insights

**1. Total Transactions and Financial Metrics**

- Savings transactions (212) follow closely, suggesting that customers actively save.

- Checking (198) and credit (204) transactions are relatively lower, which may imply a preference for long-term financial security over daily spending.
